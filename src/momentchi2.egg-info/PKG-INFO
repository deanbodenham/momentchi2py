Description: # momentchi2
        
        A Python implementation of three approximate methods for computing the 
        cumulative distribution function of a weighted sum of chi-squared
        random variables. All the methods are based on moment-matching techniques.
        
        ## Methods
        
        Based on the R package `momentchi2`, this Python version contains the following methods:
          - Hall-Buckley-Eagleson (function `hbe`)
          - Satterthwaite-Welch (function `sw`)
          - Wood's F method (function `wf`)
          - Lindsay-Pilla-Basak method (function `lpb4`)
        
        
        ## Installation instructions
        
        Install using `pip`:
        
        ```
        python3 -m pip install momentchi2
        ```
        
        ## Package dependencies
        
        The packages `numpy` and `scipy` are required to be installed.
        
        
        ## Which method should I use?
        
        All four methods (`sw`, `hbe`, `wf` and `lpb4`) are good, 
        but the **Hall-Buckley-Eagleson** method is recommended for situations 
        where the number of coefficients is modertately large 
        (say, greater than 100). For a smaller number of coefficients (e.g. up to 10), 
        the Lindsay-Pilla-Basak method is recommended.
        See Bodenham and Adams (2016) for a detailed analysis.
        
        
        
        ## Examples:
        
        ```
        ## Hall-Buckley-Eagleson method
        from momentchi2 import hbe
        
        # should give value close to 0.95, actually 0.94908
        hbe(coeff=[1.5, 1.5, 0.5, 0.5], x=10.203)            
        
        # x is a list, output approx. 0.05, 0.95
        hbe([1.5, 1.5, 0.5, 0.5], [0.627, 10.203])  
        
        # x is a numpy array - preferred approach for speed
        import numpy as np
        from momentchi2 import hbe
        hbe( np.array([1.5, 1.5, 0.5, 0.5]), np.array([0.627, 10.203]) )  
        
        # Other methods, e.g. sw, wf or lpb4
        # All methods called: methodname(coeff, x)
        from momentchi2 import sw
        sw([1.5, 1.5, 0.5, 0.5], [0.627, 10.203])  
        
        from momentchi2 import wf
        wf([1.5, 1.5, 0.5, 0.5], [0.627, 10.203])  
        
        from momentchi2 import lpb4
        lpb4([1.5, 1.5, 0.5, 0.5], [0.627, 10.203])  
        
        # for a larger number of coefficients in coeff vector, 
        # can increase the number of moments p for improved accuracy.
        # NOTE: we need len(coeff) >= p. Default value of p is p=4.
        lpb4([0.1, 2.3, 3.4, 5.6, 7.8, 8.9, 9.1], [9.366844, 82.0018], p=6)  
        ```
        
        ## Details
        
        
        All methods take two input arguments:
          * `coeff`: a list of the coefficients of the weighted sum 
          (where all values must be strictly greater than 0), and  
          * `x`: the quantile value(s) at which point(s) the cumulative distribution
          function is computed.  
        
        So calling a method is: `methodname(coeff, x)`, where e.g. `methodname` is `hbe`.
        
        Input for quantile vector `x` can be a float (single value) or a list of values, 
        or a numpy array. Internally, lists are converted to numpy arrays (and then back
        to lists), so that the output format of `x` is the same as the input format.
        
        The Lindsay-Pilla-Basak (`lpb4`) method has a parameter `p` which is set
        to 4 by default and this is sufficient in most cases. 
        If the number of coefficients is larger (e.g. greater than 8), then
        the `lpb4` method can be used for larger . Of course, the increased accuracy 
        comes at an increased computational cost.
        
        There are a few pathological cases where Wood's F method or the 
        Lindsay-Pilla-Basak method can fail (e.g. number of coefficients < p), 
        in which case the `hbe` method will be called.

        ### An exact solution: Imhof's method
        
        Note that while these methods are all approximate, they are very fast and
        are accurate to two or three decimal places.  If an 
        exact answer is required to arbitrary accuracy, consider Imhof's method, which 
        is implemented in the R package `CompQuadForm`.
